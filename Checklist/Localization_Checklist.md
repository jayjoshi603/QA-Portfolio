# Localization Checklist

This checklist ensures your application provides a consistent, culturally appropriate experience across regions, languages, and formats. It's designed for manual testing of internationalization readiness and localization accuracy for both Web and Mobile platforms.

## Regional Formats & Symbols

- [ ] Date formats adapt to locale (e.g. DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY)

- [ ] Currency formats match language and region (symbols, separators)  
- [ ] Number formats use appropriate decimal/thousand separators  
- [ ] Phone numbers follow local dialing conventions  
- [ ] Measurements reflect metric/imperial units where applicable

## Language Accuracy & Consistency

- [ ] Translations are complete and grammatically correct

## Localization Errors & Edge Cases

- [ ] Missing translations fall back gracefully
